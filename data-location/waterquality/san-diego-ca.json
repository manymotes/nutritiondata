  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Is San Diego tap water safe to drink?",
      "answer": "Yes, San Diego's tap water meets all federal and state drinking water standards. The City of San Diego conducts over 120,000 water quality tests annually and operates multiple advanced treatment facilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is San Diego water hard?",
      "answer": "San Diego's water hardness (averaging 155 mg/L) comes from natural minerals in the Colorado River and State Water Project sources. Hard water is safe to drink and provides beneficial minerals, though it may cause mineral deposits."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is 1,2,3-TCP and should I be concerned?",
      "answer": "1,2,3-TCP is a toxic solvent that contaminated some local groundwater. San Diego has taken affected wells offline and installed treatment systems. Most residents receive blended water that meets state limits. The city is working to fully eliminate this contaminant."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where does San Diego get its water?",
      "answer": "San Diego imports about 85% of its water from the Colorado River and Northern California via large aqueduct systems. About 15% comes from local sources including reservoirs and groundwater. The city is investing in water recycling and desalination for future reliability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is San Diego building a desalination plant?",
      "answer": "The Carlsbad Desalination Plant (opened 2015) provides about 10% of San Diego County's water supply. This seawater desalination facility produces drought-proof water and represents one of the region's diverse water supply strategies."
