  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Is Phoenix tap water safe to drink?",
      "answer": "Yes, Phoenix tap water meets all EPA and state drinking water standards. The city conducts over 250,000 water quality tests annually and operates state-of-the-art treatment facilities to ensure safety."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Phoenix water so hard?",
      "answer": "Phoenix water hardness (averaging 185 mg/L) comes from natural minerals in the Colorado River and local sources. Hard water is safe to drink and provides beneficial minerals, though it may cause scale buildup on fixtures and appliances."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is being done about arsenic in Phoenix water?",
      "answer": "Arsenic occurs naturally in Arizona's geology. Phoenix's arsenic levels are well below the federal limit of 10 ppb. The city uses source blending and treatment optimization to minimize arsenic levels while maintaining compliance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How secure is Phoenix's water supply given drought conditions?",
      "answer": "Phoenix has diversified its water portfolio with Colorado River water, Salt/Verde River supplies, and stored groundwater. The city has invested in conservation, infrastructure, and long-term water banking to ensure reliability through drought periods."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use a water softener in Phoenix?",
      "answer": "Water softeners are optional and a personal choice. They can reduce mineral deposits on fixtures but require maintenance and add sodium to water. The city's hard water is safe to drink and doesn't require softening for health reasons."
