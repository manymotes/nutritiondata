  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Is New York City tap water safe to drink?",
      "answer": "Yes, NYC tap water is among the highest quality in the nation. The city's water supply comes from pristine Catskill Mountain watersheds and undergoes rigorous testing. Over 1 billion gallons are tested daily for quality assurance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does NYC water taste so good?",
      "answer": "NYC water is naturally soft and filtered through the Catskill Mountain watershed. Unlike many cities, 90% of NYC's water is naturally filtered and doesn't require extensive chemical treatment, resulting in its notably fresh taste."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I worry about lead in NYC water?",
      "answer": "The water supplied by NYC is lead-free. However, lead can enter drinking water through old pipes and fixtures in buildings. The city has implemented extensive testing in schools and offers free testing for homes built before 1987."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does NYC add fluoride to the water?",
      "answer": "Yes, NYC has fluoridated its water supply since 1965 to promote dental health. The fluoride level is maintained at 0.7 mg/L, the level recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does NYC water compare to bottled water?",
      "answer": "NYC tap water meets or exceeds all federal and state drinking water standards and is tested more frequently than bottled water. It's also more environmentally friendly and costs less than a penny per gallon compared to bottled water."
