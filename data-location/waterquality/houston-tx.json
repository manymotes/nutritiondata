  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Is Houston tap water safe to drink?",
      "answer": "Yes, Houston's tap water meets all federal and state drinking water standards. The city operates multiple treatment plants and conducts thousands of water quality tests monthly to ensure safety."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Houston water taste different sometimes?",
      "answer": "Houston draws water from multiple surface water sources (lakes and rivers) which can vary in taste depending on seasonal factors, rainfall, and which plant serves your area. All sources are treated to meet quality standards."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are disinfection byproducts and should I be concerned?",
      "answer": "Disinfection byproducts (TTHMs and HAA5) form when chlorine reacts with organic matter in water. Houston's levels are below federal limits. The city uses optimized treatment processes to minimize these compounds while maintaining necessary disinfection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did Hurricane Harvey affect Houston's water?",
      "answer": "While some areas experienced temporary boil water notices, Houston's water system proved resilient. The city has since invested in infrastructure improvements and emergency preparedness to better handle extreme weather events."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I filter my Houston tap water?",
      "answer": "Houston tap water is safe to drink as-is. However, some residents use filters to improve taste or reduce chlorine. If filtering, use NSF-certified filters and maintain them according to manufacturer instructions."
