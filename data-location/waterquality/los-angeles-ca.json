  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Is Los Angeles tap water safe to drink?",
      "answer": "Yes, LA tap water meets all federal and state drinking water standards. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power conducts over 300,000 water quality tests annually to ensure safety and quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is LA water so hard?",
      "answer": "LA receives water from multiple sources, including the Colorado River and State Water Project, which naturally contain higher mineral content. The water hardness averages 145 mg/L (moderately hard), which is safe but may leave mineral deposits on fixtures."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is being done about Chromium-6?",
      "answer": "LADWP has invested over $70 million in wellhead treatment systems to remove Chromium-6. While levels are below the legal limit, the utility continues to reduce concentrations through treatment and source blending."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use a water filter in Los Angeles?",
      "answer": "While LA tap water is safe to drink, some residents choose to use filters to reduce mineral content, improve taste, or further reduce contaminants to below health goal levels. NSF-certified filters for specific contaminants are recommended if filtering."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where does LA get its water?",
      "answer": "LA imports about 85% of its water from the Eastern Sierra Nevada (LA Aqueduct), Northern California (State Water Project), and the Colorado River. About 10-15% comes from local groundwater sources in the San Fernando Valley and other basins."
